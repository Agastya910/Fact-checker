# AI Fact-Checking System

## Overview
This project presents an advanced AI fact-checking system designed to combat misinformation and bias in the digital media landscape. Leveraging cutting-edge transformer models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-3, the system provides nuanced analysis of the veracity of digital content and generates transparent, understandable explanations for its decisions. 

### Research Paper Abstract:
In this study, we address the challenges of misinformation and bias that plague public discourse in the digital age. By utilizing advanced transformer models, the fact-checking system achieves high accuracy and provides explanations that are crucial for transparency and trust in AI. The system was trained on a diverse set of datasets including PolitiFact, India News Headlines, FakeNewsIndia, and FactDrill, ensuring a broad evaluation across political, regional, and multilingual contexts. Our models, particularly RoBERTa, achieved up to 95% accuracy in fact-checking, with a focus on both correctness and explanatory coherence.

## Key Features
- **State-of-the-Art AI Models**: The system utilizes BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-3 to analyze and verify claims with deep contextual understanding.
- **Multilingual Fact-Checking**: The inclusion of the FactDrill dataset allows for fact-checking across multiple Indian languages.
- **Explanatory Coherence (EC)**: A custom metric to evaluate not only the factual correctness but also the clarity and usefulness of the explanations provided by the system.
- **Dataset Diversity**: Models are trained on a combination of datasets focusing on political claims, regional news, election-related misinformation, and multilingual content.
- **High Accuracy**: RoBERTa, for instance, achieved up to 95% accuracy on the PolitiFact dataset.

## Datasets
This system was developed using the following datasets:
- **PolitiFact Fact Check Dataset**: A dataset of over 21,000 fact-checked political claims.
- **India News Headlines Dataset**: A collection of 3.3 million news events from India, spanning multiple topics such as politics, economy, and society.
- **FakeNewsIndia Dataset**: Contains 4,803 fake news incidents, particularly focused on misinformation related to Indian elections.
- **FactDrill Dataset**: A multilingual dataset of fact-checked social media content in 13 Indian languages.

## Methodology
The project follows a rigorous methodology involving dataset curation, model selection, fine-tuning, and performance evaluation. Key components of the methodology include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizing, cleaning, and tokenizing the data.
- **Fine-Tuning Transformer Models**: Using transfer learning techniques to adapt BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-3 to the fact-checking task.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Explanatory Coherence (EC).

## Performance
The models were evaluated on several datasets, with the following key results:
- **FakeNewsIndia Dataset**:
  - **BERT**: Accuracy 91%, Precision 89%, Recall 90%, F1 Score 0.895, EC Rating 82%
  - **RoBERTa**: Accuracy 94%, Precision 93%, Recall 92%, F1 Score 0.925, EC Rating 86%
  - **GPT-3**: Accuracy 89%, Precision 87%, Recall 88%, F1 Score 0.875, EC Rating 80%
  
- **FactDrill Dataset**:
  - Similar high performance, with RoBERTa leading the results across all metrics.

## Installation and Usage
### Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook for development

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AI-Fact-Checker.git
   cd AI-Fact-Checker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Model:
1. Preprocess the datasets and load the models:
   ```python
   from transformers import RobertaForSequenceClassification, RobertaTokenizer
   model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('roberta-large')
   tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-large')
   ```

2. Input a claim to be fact-checked:
   ```python
   claim = "The Earth is flat."
   inputs = tokenizer(claim, return_tensors='pt')
   outputs = model(**inputs)
   prediction = outputs.logits.argmax()
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
   ```

3. Generate an explanation for the fact-check:
   ```python
   explanation = model.generate_explanation(claim)
   print(f"Explanation: {explanation}")
   ```
